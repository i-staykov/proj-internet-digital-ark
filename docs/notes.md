# Decision log - lightweight ADR

Short notes on why I made certain architectural design choices. Details belong in the report.

## 2026-07-21

- **uv** for Python, deps, environments
  - one tool, and `uv.lock` makes a fresh clone reproduce the exact environment
- **just** as command runner
  - familiar from work, self-documenting shortcuts; raw `uv run` stays the documented fallback
- **CI on GitHub Actions** (lint, format check, tests on every push)
  - familiar from work and cheap insurance that a clean machine still builds
  - unit tests only, network mocked: keeps CI fast and deterministic
- **Large data stays out of git**
  - legacy baseline (~1.2 GB) and intermediates are ignored; only net-new output + evidence manifest get committed
- **Baseline never modified, output is disjoint net-new**
  - legacy files load read-only for dedup; our additions ship separately so the group can verify before merging
- **DuckDB + SQLite**, one per workload
  - DuckDB: system of record + analytics (dedup, yield stats, exports)
  - SQLite (WAL): crawler work-queue, many tiny commits for crash-resume; stdlib, zero extra deps
    - `claim` is a single SQL statement, which is what makes double-claiming impossible without any locking code in future parallelization.
- **PSL (Public Suffix List) snapshot pinned in the repo** (for `tldextract`)
  - the registrable domain is our output unit; live-fetching the suffix list would make it depend on download day
- **PSL** used to canonicalize how domains are converted into registerables as per III.8
- **Evidence rule enforced by the schema**
  - `domain_year.evidence_id` is NOT NULL, so an unevidenced year assignment is impossible; tested
  - all writes go through helpers; `assign_year` takes only an evidence id and derives domain + year from that row, so a mismatched assignment cannot be expressed
    - **a piece of evidence valid for multiple years is regarded as different pieces of evidence**
- **Baseline unit is the registered domain (III.8)**
  - the legacy files contain hostnames (1.4M lines with subdomains like `001sun01.marshall.com`); we collapse to registered domains, so counts differ from the prior line counts (8.2M lines -> 6.87M domain-year pairs); documented, files untouched
- **2026 PSL + historical ccTLD patch, not a "2001 PSL"**
  - no authoritative 2001 list exists (the PSL started ~2007) and early lists were less complete; we pin today's PSL and add retired ccTLDs (`.yu`, `.an`, ...) as extra suffixes, recovering ~1.8k real early-web domains
- **Underscores tolerated in discarded subdomains only**
  - `a_ashe.howard.edu` -> `howard.edu` is recovered; an underscore in the registered label itself stays invalid
- **Full droplist is a committed deliverable**
  - `output/legacy_review/dropped_domains.txt`: every provided line we exclude (0.149%), grouped by reason, reproducible via `ark legacy-review`

## 2026-07-22

- **Optimization target: net-new volume** (Prof. Ding: "let's use the results to tell")
  - the scored metric is the count of non-overlapping, evidence-backed domains vs the provided baseline; source order now follows expected yield
  - validity and evidence rules stay unchanged: every counted domain remains deduplicated, evidence-backed, and valid

- **Prior URL seed files are near-exhausted for new domains**
  - probing 200k lines of `deduplicated_urls_2001-2002` yielded 3 domains not already in the baseline; the prior work evidently mined these files
  - consequence: bulk archive indexes (Arquivo.pt, UK Web Archive) move up the source order; seed files stay as a low-priority back-verification pool
- **Stray separator punctuation around a name is salvaged** (`.www.foo.com` -> `foo.com`)
  - only characters that cannot belong to any label (dots, commas); a leading hyphen would alter the name itself and stays invalid
  - recovered just 11 baseline lines; kept because the upcoming URL seed files are far messier
- **Percent-encoding is decoded, not stripped** (`%20foo.ab.ca` -> `foo.ab.ca`)
  - decoded characters either belong to the hostname or cause rejection; non-ascii results stay rejected, which matches the era (IDN only exists since 2003)

- **What "unverified" means (evidence standard for negatives)**
  - a candidate stays unverified only after deterministic empty answers from the index for all six year windows; transport errors are retried, empty answers are not
  - the first three unverified domains were re-probed without the status-200 filter: still zero captures, so IA genuinely never archived them in-window
  - absence in one archive is not proof of non-existence: WHOIS and other archives remain open routes, hence candidate pool, not rejection
- **Verification queries match `*.domain`** (domain plus all subdomains)
  - a 1998 capture of `shop.foo.com` proves `foo.com` existed in 1998; the earlier prefix form missed subdomain-only captures
- **Delivery spec adopted (Prof. Ding, feedback #2)**
  - approach confirmed: registered-domain unit, untouched originals, separate additions, conservative salvage
  - added obligations: normalization/salvage audit file, execution logs kept from every run, merged master lists + full archive (with checksum) at delivery
  - merged master lists (~180MB) ship in the archive, not in git; net-new additions stay committed in `output/`

- **UKWA bulk CDX (JISC 1996-2013) is not publicly retrievable in 2026 (finding)**
  - `data.webarchive.org.uk` is a stale DNS alias to a retired GitHub Pages domain; the successor path on `www.webarchive.org.uk` soft-404s even the correct filenames (`1996.cdx.gz` ... `2013.cdx.gz`, recovered from a 2015 Wayback snapshot of the directory listing)
  - the BL research repository record (`bl.iro.bl.uk`, dataset `3c39a755-...`) is metadata-only and its download link points back to the dead host; the dataset DOI 404s; Wayback never archived the files; no archive.org mirror; GLAM Workbench cites the dead DOI
  - path forward: request access from the British Library (`web-archivist@bl.uk`); Arquivo.pt promoted to bulk wave 1 meanwhile
  - report material: link rot took the SPEC's own primary source offline within ~15 years, which is itself the strongest argument for this project's premise
  - 2026-07-22: access request sent via the BL repository contact form (bl.iro.bl.uk/contact), citing the record and the broken link; treated as fire-and-forget, not a blocker

- **Arquivo.pt bulk CDXJ has no 1996-2001 coverage (finding)**
  - 214 collection files (18-374 GB each, multi-TB total), named by collection not year
  - sampled AWP1 (the earliest-numbered collection): 40 MB slice = 227k captures, all timestamped 2008, none in our window
  - Arquivo's crawls begin 2008 (like Common Crawl); its bulk dumps are out-of-window and too large to mine for a sliver → not a source for 1996-2001
- **Reality check on bulk sources for 1996-2001 (strategic)**
  - of the SPEC's named bulk index sources, Arquivo = 2008+, UKWA = link-rotted (access requested), Common Crawl = 2008+
  - the Internet Archive (Wayback) is effectively the one archive with broad 1996-2001 coverage, and it is primarily per-domain via the CDX API, not a bulk download
  - consequence: the volume engine shifts from "download-and-parse bulk indexes" to (a) dated directory/portal snapshots where the snapshot date evidences every listed domain (no per-domain calls), and (b) a large candidate pool (DMOZ, seed files) verified against IA CDX at scale, which makes async throughput necessary rather than optional

## Definition: what we count as a valid domain

Implemented in [`src/ark/canonical.py`](../src/ark/canonical.py) (`to_registrable`); every domain from every source passes through it before touching the database. A line counts as a valid domain if, after the steps below, a registered domain remains:

1. **Normalize.** Percent-decode, trim whitespace, lowercase. Strip URL parts if present: scheme (`http://`), path/query/fragment, userinfo (`user@`), port (`:80`), plus stray separator punctuation around the name (leading/trailing dots and commas).
2. **Require hostname syntax.** Labels of letters, digits, hyphens (no hyphen at a label edge). Underscores are tolerated, but only in subdomain labels that get discarded anyway. IP addresses are not domains.
3. **Split against the Public Suffix List** (pinned snapshot of 2026-07-20, plus a documented patch of retired ccTLDs like `.yu`, `.an`). The result must have both a registered label and a public suffix. This rejects bare suffixes (`ab.ca` is a registry zone, not a registration) and suffix-less names (`localhost`).
4. **Keep only the registered domain** (registered label + suffix, e.g. `bbc.co.uk`), discarding subdomains (`www.`, machine names) per SPEC III.8.

Everything else is dropped with a stated reason; the droplist above holds every dropped baseline line for inspection.
